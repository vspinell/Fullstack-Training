### Return Codes

#### 400

If the format of the id is incorrect, then we will end up in the error handler defined in the catch block. The appropriate status code for the situation is 400 Bad Request because the situation fits the description perfectly

> The 400 (Bad Request) status code indicates that the server cannot or will not process the request due to something that is perceived to be a client error (e.g., malformed request syntax, invalid request message framing, or deceptive request routing).
