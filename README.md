## Guide to repository

Each branch comes with a small inceremental takeaway.
The branches follow this semantic pattern `(backend|frontend)/<incremental step>`

You can find the teory and some takeaways **[here](Docs/README.md)**

## Backend

To start the backend first intall the dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

To run the server in development mode run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Api client

To send requests to the server use the Rest CLIENT VS Code extension. Find out more on this [page](https://github.com/Huachao/vscode-restclient/blob/master/README.md#usage)

1. Install the extension
2. Under `Backend/requests` open the api you want to try and click on `send Request`
